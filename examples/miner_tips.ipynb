        "Only posts that passes the check is eligable for rewards.\n",

You can find the list of legacy users here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gdams/twitter-legacy-verified/main/legacy-verified.csv\n",

        "\n",
        "- Only engagement from legacy users counts towards the score of the miner, so targeting them with your posts is ideal. You can directly reply to their post in order to try to get engagement from them. Do remember that their response has to be neutral or positive for it to count."
